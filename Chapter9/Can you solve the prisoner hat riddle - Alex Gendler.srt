1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,840
You and nine other individuals have been captured

2
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,500
by super-intelligent alien overlords.

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,820
The aliens think humans look quite tasty,

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,180
but their civilization forbids eating highly logical and cooperative beings.

5
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,860
Unfortunately, they're not sure whether you qualify,

6
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:32,740
so they decide to give you all a test.

7
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:38,020
Through its universal translator, the alien guarding you tells you the following.

8
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:43,419
You will be placed in a single file line facing forward in size order

9
00:00:43,419 --> 00:00:47,360
so that each of you can see everyone lined up ahead of you.

10
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,299
You will not be able to look behind you or step out of line.

11
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:55,860
Each of you will have either a black or a white hat on your head,

12
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,299
assigned randomly,

13
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:01,279
and I won't tell you how many of each color there are.

14
00:01:01,279 --> 00:01:05,519
When I say to begin, each of you must guess the color of your hat,

15
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,500
starting with the person in the back and moving up the line.

16
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,919
And don't even try saying words other than black or white,

17
00:01:12,919 --> 00:01:17,120
or signaling some other way, like intonation or volume.

18
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,760
You'll all be eaten immediately.

19
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,099
If at least nine of you guess correctly, you'll all be spared.

20
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:27,519
You have five minutes to discuss and come up with a plan,

21
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:32,080
and then I'll line you up, assign your hats, and we'll begin.

22
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,059
Can you think of a strategy guaranteed to save everyone?

23
00:01:36,059 --> 00:01:39,040
Pause the video now if you want to figure it out for yourself.

24
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,040
Answer in 3

25
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,040
Answer in 2

26
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,040
Answer in 1

27
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,040
Answer in 2

28
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,040
Answer in 1

29
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,040
The key is that the person at the back of the line

30
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,239
who can see everyone else's hats

31
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:53,959
can use the words black or white to communicate some coded information.

32
00:01:54,019 --> 00:01:56,739
So what meaning can be assigned to those words

33
00:01:56,739 --> 00:02:00,779
that will allow everyone else to deduce their hat colors?

34
00:02:00,779 --> 00:02:04,419
It can't be the total number of black or white hats.

35
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:07,019
There are more than two possible values.

36
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:11,979
But what does have two possible values is that number's parity,

37
00:02:11,979 --> 00:02:15,179
that is, whether it's odd or even.

38
00:02:15,179 --> 00:02:19,860
So the solution is to agree that whoever goes first will, for example,

39
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,740
say black if he sees an odd number of black hats,

40
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,800
and white if he sees an even number of black hats.

41
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,399
Let's see how it would play out if the hats were distributed like this.

42
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:35,639
The tallest captive sees three black hats in front of him,

43
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,039
so he says black,

44
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:40,679
telling everyone else he sees an odd number of black hats.

45
00:02:40,679 --> 00:02:44,000
He gets his own hat color wrong, but that's okay,

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,320
since you're collectively allowed to have one wrong answer.

47
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,600
Prisoner two also sees an odd number of black hats,

48
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:55,300
so she knows hers is white and answers correctly.

49
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,339
Prisoner three sees an even number of black hats,

50
00:02:58,339 --> 00:03:03,619
so he knows that his must be one of the black hats the first two prisoners saw.

51
00:03:03,619 --> 00:03:06,699
Prisoner four hears that and knows that she should be looking

52
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:10,800
for an even number of black hats, since one was behind her.

53
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,399
But she only sees one, so she deduces that her hat is also black.

54
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:20,979
Prisoners five through nine are each looking for an odd number of black hats,

55
00:03:21,059 --> 00:03:25,520
each they see, so they figure out that their hats are white.

56
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,199
Now it all comes down to you at the front of the line.

57
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:32,440
If the ninth prisoner saw an odd number of black hats,

58
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,100
that can only mean one thing.

59
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,759
You'll find that this strategy works for any possible arrangement of the hats.

60
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:44,779
The first prisoner has a 50% chance of giving a wrong answer about his own hat,

61
00:03:44,779 --> 00:03:48,440
but the parity information he conveys allows everyone else

62
00:03:48,779 --> 00:03:52,039
to guess theirs with absolute certainty.

63
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:56,199
Each begins by expecting to see an odd or even number of hats

64
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:58,080
of the specified color.

65
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,800
If what they count doesn't match, that means their own hat is that color.

66
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,240
And every time this happens,

67
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,899
the next person in line will switch the parity they expect to see.

68
00:04:08,899 --> 00:04:09,740
So that's it.

69
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,839
You're free to go.

70
00:04:10,839 --> 00:04:13,679
It looks like these aliens will have to go hungry,

71
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:16,579
or find some less logical organisms to abduct.
